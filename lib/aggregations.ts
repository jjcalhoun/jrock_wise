/**
 * Core aggregation logic — ported from BudgetApp.jsx prototype.
 *
 * Rules (locked — from schema.sql and Design Brief):
 *  - Category/bucket spend = expense splits MINUS refund splits (refunds claw back).
 *  - Income = type:'income' only.
 *  - Transfers touch balances only — excluded from spending and income.
 *  - Account balance = starting_balance + transactions dated STRICTLY AFTER as_of_date.
 *  - Splits are SIGNED like the parent amount (expense splits are negative).
 *  - The "spend contribution" of a split is -split.amount
 *    (expense negative → positive spend; refund positive → negative spend = claw-back).
