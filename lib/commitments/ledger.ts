/* The free-to-spend ledger, over commitments.
 *
 *   expected income (commitments)
 * − commitments (planned until their transaction posts, then the actual)
 * = baseline
 * − discretionary spend (unlinked, cash-view)
 * + extra income (actual income beyond the plan)
 * = free to spend
 *
 * Two things differ from the month-plan version this replaces:
 *
 *  1. ONE source of truth. Links are `transactions.commitment_id` and nothing
 *     else — the render-time autoLinkByRule overlay is gone, so the ledger and
 *     the picker can no longer disagree about whether a bill is paid.
 *
 *  2. Dates carry little weight. A linked transaction counts toward its
 *     COMMITMENT's period, whatever date it actually posted, so a bill due the
 *     31st that clears on the 1st lands in the month that expected it. Only
 *     unlinked spending is bucketed by its own date.
 *
 * TWO VIEWS OF A CREDIT CARD.
 *
 *   CASH  — when did money leave your pocket? A card purchase doesn't reduce
 *           free-to-spend; the monthly card payment does. True to your bank
 *           balance, but a week of swiping shows up as nothing at all, and
 *           spending on a card with no payment line vanishes entirely.
 *
 *   SPEND — that, PLUS the purchases as you make them.
 *
 * The card payment keeps counting in both, and it is worth being clear why,
 * because the first version of this got it wrong. When a card is paid in full
 * every month, the purchases and the payment that clears them are one event
 * seen twice, and counting both would double-charge. WHEN A BALANCE IS
 * CARRIED THEY ARE DIFFERENT MONEY: the payment retires debt you already owe,
 * while this month's purchases create new debt. Both are real claims on this
 * month's income, so both count — that is what "don't overspend, and pay the
 * cards down" actually requires.
 *
 * (Building it the other way made turning the toggle ON raise free-to-spend,
 * because dropping the payment gave back more than the purchases took. A
 * setting called "count card spending" that increases what you can spend is
 * its own proof of a wrong model.)
 *
 * LOAN accounts are excluded from spending in BOTH views. Interest and escrow
 * post as charges against the loan, but they are consequences of a payment
 * that already counted — they belong in the category rollup (so escrow shows
 * under Housing) and nowhere near free-to-spend.
 *
 * Transfers between cash accounts are neutral in both.
