/* Income counted twice.
 *
 * August read $6,979 of income against a real $4,631. Two deposits — a $420
 * payday allocation and an $1,845.67 ADP paycheck — had arrived and were never
 * matched to the plan lines expecting them. The lines counted from the 1st;
 * the deposits counted again as income beyond the plan. Same money, twice,
 * with nothing on any screen saying so.
 *
 * It slipped through review because the matcher refused to pre-select: two
 * paydays a month are identical apart from their date, so neither was ever
 * "clearly better than the runner-up". Both halves are covered here — spotting
 * it after the fact, and not creating it in the first place.
