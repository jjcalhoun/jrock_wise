/* Income that arrived and was never matched to the plan line expecting it.
 *
 * This one is expensive, because it counts the same money twice. The plan line
 * counts from the 1st whether or not the deposit shows up; the deposit, if
 * nothing links it, counts again as income beyond the plan. A paycheck that
 * slipped through review therefore INFLATES the month by its whole value, and
 * nothing on any screen says so — August read $6,979 of income against a real
 * $4,631.
 *
 * Why it slips: two paydays a month are identical apart from their date, so
 * the matcher refuses to pre-select either (see suggestCommitment — a
 * suggestion has to be clearly better than the runner-up). You review the
 * deposit, nothing is offered, you move on. Every month.
 *
 * A deposit is only reported here when the plan is genuinely still expecting
 * money of that size. Real windfalls — a refund, a gift, a side job — are
 * extra income and belong in the number, so they are left alone.
